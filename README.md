## Getting Started with `simple_money_lib`

`simple_money_lib` makes it simple to work with currencies and monetary values. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of its core features and usage examples.

### 1. Creating Currencies
Define or retrieve a currency using its ISO code:
```python
from simple_money_lib.currency import Currency
from simple_money_lib.errors import CurrencyExistsError

# Import a predefined currency
from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import EUR, USD
print(EUR)  # Output: EUR

# Retrieve a predefined currency
usd = Currency("USD")
print(usd)  # Output: USD
print(usd is USD)  # Output: True - the imported and retrieved currency is the same object

# Dynamically register a new currency
btc = Currency.register(code="BTC", numeric=1000, sub_unit=8, name="Bitcoin")
print(btc)  # Output: BTC
# The registration is persistent
# Try to register again in default mode, with different numeric value
try:
    btc2 = Currency.register(code="BTC", numeric=10000, sub_unit=8, name="Bitcoin")
except CurrencyExistsError:
    pass
else:
    print("This works when strict mode is off (default).")

# The registered currency is not overwritten by subsequent registrations
print(btc2.numeric)  # Output: 1000, not 10000

# Try to register again in strict mode
Currency.strict_mode = True
try:
    btc3 = Currency.register(code="BTC", numeric=1000, sub_unit=8, name="Bitcoin")
except CurrencyExistsError:
    print("If strict mode is on, trying to register a currency again will raise an error")
```

To edit a custom currency, find it in `data/user_currencies.json` and edit manually.

### 2. Creating Money Objects

Work with monetary values by combining an amount and a currency:

```python
from simple_money_lib.money import Money
from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import USD

# Create a money object - option 1
money = Money(100, "USD")
print(money)  # Output: 100.00 USD

# Create a money object - option 2
money = Money(100, USD)
print(money)  # Output: 100.00 USD

# Create a money object - option 3
money = Money('USD 100')  # Or '100 USD'
print(money)  # Output: 100.00 USD

# Default currency is configurable
default_money = Money(50)
print(default_money)  # Output: 50.00 XXX (default currency can be set globally)
```

### 3. Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations can be performed between Money objects with the same Currency and numeric types (int, float, Decimal) as makes sense.

```python
from simple_money_lib.money import Money
import decimal
# Addition and subtraction: between Money objects
money1 = Money(100, "USD")
money2 = Money("50 USD")
print(money1 + money2)       # Output: 150.00 USD
print(money1 - money2)       # Output: 50.00 USD

# Multiplication and division: between Money and numeric types
print(money1 * 2)            # Output: 200.00 USD
print(money1 / 2)            # Output: 50.00 USD
print(Money("5 EUR") // 3)   # Output: 1.00 EUR
print(Money("5 EUR") % 3)    # Output: 2.00 EUR

# Possibility to keep track of amounts lost due to quantization / rounding
result, adjustment = Money("20 USD").divide_with_adjustment(7)
print(result, adjustment)    # Output: 2.85 USD, 0.05 USD
# Explanation: 2.85 * 7 => 19.95, 20.00 - 19.95 = 0.05

# Absolute value
print(abs(Money("-5 EUR")))  # Output: 5.00 EUR
print(abs(Money("5 EUR")))   # Output: 5.00 EUR

# Rounding operations
money = Money("15.25 EUR")
# Pre-set default behaviour is ROUND_DOWN
print(round(money, 1))        # Output: 15.20 EUR
Money.rounding.set_default(decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP)
print(round(money, 1))        # Output: 15.30 EUR
# It is possible to change rounding mode for the current thread independently on global default:
Money.rounding.set_default(decimal.ROUND_UP)
print(round(money, 1))        # Output: 15:30 EUR
Money.rounding.set(decimal.ROUND_DOWN)
print(round(money, 1))        # Output: 15:20 EUR
Money.rounding.reset()        # Local thread rounding reset, default will be used
print(round(money, 1))        # Output: 15:30 EUR
# Rounding to decimal digits greater than allowed subunit results in the same amount
print(round(money, 3))        # Output: 15.25 - only two decimal digits are allowed

# Comparison operations: <, >, ==, !=, >=, <=
money1 = Money("15.25 EUR")
money2 = Money("15 EUR")
print(money2 < money1)        # Output: True
print(money == money1)        # Output: True
```

### 4. Currency Collections

Currencies are grouped into modules and collections for ease of import.
```python
from simple_money_lib.currencies import all_iso_currencies, brics_currencies, major_currencies
from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import XXX, EUR, USD
from simple_money_lib.currencies.brics import BRL
print(XXX in all_iso_currencies)  # True
print(USD in major_currencies)    # True - note that USD is imported from simple_money_lib.currencies.all
print(EUR in brics_currencies)    # True
print(BRL in all_iso_currencies)  # True - note that BRL is imported from simple_money_lib.currencies.brics

# If you want all 'standard' currencies, do the following:
from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import *
# This is primarily useful for readability of auto-generated modules.
...
