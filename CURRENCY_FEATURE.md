### Summary of Requirements

#### **Plain Language (For README or Requirements Discussion)**

1. **TODO: Predefined Currencies for Simplicity**:
   - The library provides predefined currency objects (e.g., `SEK` for Swedish Krona) that can be directly imported. This is especially useful for users transitioning from `moneyed` or older scripts.

2. **Dynamic Currency Creation**:
   - Users can request a currency by its code (e.g., `Currency.get("SEK")`) even if it's not predefined. The library will dynamically create it if valid information is available.

3. **Singleton Behavior**:
   - Each currency is a unique object. If a currency (e.g., `SEK`) has already been created or predefined, the library will always return the same object.

4. **Thread Safety**:
   - The library ensures safe handling of currency objects in multithreaded environments. No two threads can create the same currency simultaneously.

5. **Customizable Behavior**:
   - Developers can add or define new currencies by registering them manually or extending the dynamic creation logic.

6. **Compatibility with Wildcard Imports**:
   - Commonly used currencies (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`) are predefined and available for wildcard imports (`from ... import *`) for easier integration with legacy systems.

7. **Extensible and Robust Design**:
   - The library is designed to support both pre-registered currencies and on-demand creation, providing flexibility for diverse use cases.

#### **Technical Terms (For Developer Documentation)**

1. **Predefined Currency Objects**:
   - Commonly used currencies are pre-created and made accessible via explicit imports (e.g., `from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import SEK`) or wildcard imports (e.g., `from simple_money_lib.currencies.all import *`).

2. **Dynamic Currency Resolution**:
   - A `Currency.get(code: str)` class method dynamically resolves or creates a `Currency` instance when requested. If metadata for the currency is not available, a `ValueError` or custom exception is raised.

3. **Singleton Design Pattern**:
   - The `Currency` class enforces a strict singleton pattern using a registry (`_registry`) and a thread lock (`_lock`). Duplicate attempts to register the same currency raise a `CurrencyExistsError`.

4. **Thread-Safe Registration**:
   - A lock (`threading.Lock`) ensures that concurrent attempts to create or retrieve a `Currency` object do not lead to race conditions or duplicate instances.

5. **Dynamic Attribute Access**:
   - The `__getattr__` mechanism in the `currencies.all` module allows dynamic access to currencies by their ISO codes. If the requested currency is not predefined, it is either dynamically created or raises an `AttributeError`.

6. **Module-Level Namespace Updates**:
   - Dynamically created currencies are added to the `currencies.all` module's namespace (`globals()`), enabling direct imports for newly registered currencies.

7. **Compatibility with `moneyed`**:
   - The library mimics the behavior of `moneyed` for predefined currencies, supporting existing scripts with minimal changes.

8. **Extensible Metadata Resolution**:
   - A centralized `dynamic_currency_resolver` function or mechanism allows for defining fallback metadata for unregistered currencies, supporting both manual and automated extension of the library.

9. **Wildcard Import Control**:
   - The `__all__` attribute in `currencies.all` explicitly defines which currencies are exported during wildcard imports. Dynamically added currencies can optionally be included in `__all__`.
